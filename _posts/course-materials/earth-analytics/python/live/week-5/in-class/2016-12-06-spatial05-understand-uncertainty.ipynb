    "Measurement **accuracy** is a concept that relates to whether there is bias in\n",

    "measurements, i.e. whether the expected value of our observations is close to\n",
    "\n",
    "the true value. For low accuracy measurements, we may collect many observations,\n",

    "many observations would provide a good measure of the true value. This is\n",
    "\n",
    "different from **precision**, which typically refers to the variation among\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systematic error:** a systematic error is one that tends to shift all measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "in a systematic way. This means that the mean value of a set of measurements is\n",
    "\n",
    "consistently displaced or varied in a predictable way, leading to inaccurate observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causes of systematic errors may be known or unknown but should always be corrected for when present.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, no instrument can ever be calibrated perfectly, so when a group of measurements systematically differ from the value of a standard reference specimen, an adjustment in the values should be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic error can be corrected for only when the \"true value\" (such as the value assigned to a calibration or reference specimen) is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Remote sensing instruments need to be calibrated. For example a laser in\n",
    "\n",
    "a lidar system may be tested in a lab to ensure that the distribution of output light energy\n",
    "\n",
    "is consistent every time the laser \"fires\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random error:** is a component of the total error which, in the course of a number of measurements, varies in an unpredictable way. It is not possible to correct for random error.  Random errors can occur for a variety of reasons such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of equipment sensitivity. An instrument may not be able to respond to or indicate a change in some quantity that is too small or the observer may not be able to discern the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Noise in the measurement.  Noise is extraneous disturbances that are unpredictable or random and cannot be completely accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imprecise definition. It is difficult to exactly define the dimensions of a object.  For example, it is difficult to determine the ends of a crack with measuring its length.  Two people may likely pick two different starting and ending points.\n",
