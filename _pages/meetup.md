Are you involved or interested in statistics, machine learning, programming, geo-hacking, computer science, and data collection/curation/wrangling?
If so, consider joining the Earth Lab data meetup group.
We are a group of researchers across multiple departments that meet weekly, Fridays from 1-2 PM in room S372 in the MacAllister Building (SEEC) in the Research Park on East Campus to discuss and work on contemporary problems in the Earth data science.
In the past we have had:

- talks about data or analysis problems that we encounter, using the group as a think tank
- workshops on special topics and methodology (e.g., extreme value theory), sourcing speakers locally and from other institutions
- paper discussions revolving around quantitative/data issues in the natural sciences

No expertise is necessary to join.
Go to the [Earth Lab data meetup GitHub repository](https://github.com/earthlab/meetup) to see how to get involved!
